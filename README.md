# FE5116 - Programming and Advanced Numerical Methods

This repository contains MATLAB codes developed for the FE5116 course on Programming and Advanced Numerical Methods.

# Overview

- All code is written in **MATLAB**.
- Some of the codes have been adapted or directly taken from my professor Fabio Cannizzo's repository.
- Other codes are developed independently by me as part of the course.

# Acknowledgments

- Thanks to Professor Fabio Cannizzo for all the learnings in the course.
